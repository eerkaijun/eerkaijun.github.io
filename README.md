## Welcome!

Hiya! I'm [Kai](https://twitter.com/kaijuneer). I'm a software engineer and I primarily work in the web3 space. My interest lies in open protocols, cryptography, privacy systems and decentralized finance.

My mental model of the value of web3 is an open internet where every applications that are deployed are merely building blocks. These building blocks can be composed together to create new applications. It is an internet where systems are no longer siloed and behind walled gardens, but rather interoperable with each other, which lowers the entry barriers for developers and also allow the creation of better and more integrated products. While the protocols and applications should be interoperable, the privacy of the data should be programmable. There is still much design space in this area.

I first started developing in web3 in 2020 when I was involved in academic research on privacy in decentralized identity system (side note: published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04624) too). Since then, I've worked on open source projects, DeFi protocols, my own startups and various fun hackathons.

Navigate to:
- [Open source projects](./docs/open-source.md) for some open source projects I've contributed to
- [Startups](./docs/startups.md) for my thoughts and learnings from building a startup
- [Work](./docs/work.md) for the products and involvements in my work
- [Hackathons](./docs/hackathons.md) for smaller standalone projects I've experimented
