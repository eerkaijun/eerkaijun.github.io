## Writings

Some writings I've done that usually cover my thoughts on web3 and ocassionally some technical topics:
- [KZG Privacy Pools](https://ethresear.ch/t/kzg-privacy-pools/17750) which walks through using KZG (instead of merkle trees) to construct proof of membership and proof of non-membership

More to come soon!
