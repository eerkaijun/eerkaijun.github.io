## Writings

Some writings I've done that usually cover my thoughts on web3 and ocassionally some technical topics:
- [FRI code walkthrough](https://kaijuneer.medium.com/fri-polynomial-commitment-with-code-walkthrough-ca5e4b4b2b3d) that does a step by step explanation of the FRI protocol together with code snippets
- [KZG Privacy Pools](https://ethresear.ch/t/kzg-privacy-pools/17750) which walks through using KZG (instead of merkle trees) to construct proof of membership and proof of non-membership
- [KZG code walkthrough](https://kaijuneer.medium.com/explaining-kzg-commitment-with-code-walkthrough-216638a620c9) that does a step by step explanation of the KZG protocol together with code snippets

More to come soon!
